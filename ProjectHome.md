The goal for this project is to create a game for practicing calculation and letters for kids. The idea has been to utilize the synthetic voice built in the windows operating system.

Requirement: To fully utilize the program one should use "Jaws" (www.freedomscientific.com) together with this program.

The program is built to be run in swedish and english.
